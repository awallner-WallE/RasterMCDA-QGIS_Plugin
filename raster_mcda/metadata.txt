    Plugin implementing MCDA calculations, for raster datasets.
    RasterMCDA was implemented during my Bachelor studies in Geoinformation at the Carinthia University of Applied Science.
    This was the first time for me implementing a QGIS Plugin.
    Plugin and online documentation are WORK IN PROGRESS
    Link to online documentation:
    https://github.com/awallner-WallE/RasterMCDA-QGIS_Plugin
    Most of the implemented functions are based on: Malczewski, J. (1999) GIS and Multicriteria Decision Analysis. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York.
